### The "ChessFlow" name was actually AI-generated.

It’s surprisingly difficult to come up with a name for a chess-related app that sounds good and isn’t already in use. We brainstormed ideas for quite some time before settling on this one. To generate ideas, we used ChatGPT and DeepSeek with very simple prompts.

### Researching Rust WASM threads

This task became a whole endeavor that took several days. I used ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Gemini for research, as this is quite a niche topic with limited resources available online. Most of the prompts were like “Google searches,” asking the AI to dive into documentation and examine the code of many open-source crates to find something that could work for my use case. Finding a crate that was actually updated to work with newer Rust versions was a tough challenge, as multithreaded WASM is still extremely new.

### Learning Rust

Although the Rust Book and other learning resources are quite good, when encountering a new construct, it’s usually faster to just ask the AI to explain it rather than search through the docs to piece everything together. A good example of this is understanding the `Arc<Mutex<T>>` pattern.

### Spellchecking and rephrasing text across the whole project

For example, this entire README was proofread and polished by ChatGPT.
