## Comments

* These are scattered all around the project.
    * Comments with URLs pointing to specs.
    * Comments explaining the reasoning chain through nested condition trees.
    * Comments denoting possible improvements or things that are known to have issues and need fixing.



## Code standards

* The most obvious example of this is the Rust-JS bindings. These need to respect a strict contract on what their signature can look like and what resources they can access.

* The majority of the Rust code is also forced to follow its strict code standards regarding lifetimes, borrowing, type checking, and error handling.
